My name is Elliot Nelson, and I'm a software engineer. This website is my personal blog, where I sometimes post articles about programming or software development, separated by long periods of silence. All opinions are strictly my own.

## What's good?

 - [js13k](/js13k)
 - [This blog!](/)
 - The best editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - The best theme: [An Old Hope](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dustinsanders.an-old-hope-theme-vscode#overview)
   - The best font: [DejaVu Sans Mono](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) (@300 Font Weight)
     - Worth mentioning: Inconsolata, Fira Mono, and Fira Code all look _cooler_ than DejaVu. But, I get the maximum number of hours of strain-free eyeballs with this font, so it's my workhorse.
   - And of course, [https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim](VSCodeVim)
 - [Compassionate Coding](https://medium.com/compassionate-coding)
 - Ruby, Javascript, & Groovy
 - All the other languages... grudgingly
 - Roller coasters
 - Unit testing
