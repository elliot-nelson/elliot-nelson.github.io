Hi there! My name is Elliot Nelson, and I'm a software engineer. This site is my personal blog, where I sometimes post articles about programming and software development, followed by long periods of silence.

*Likes:*

- Ruby, Javascript, Groovy, C
- Data structures and algorithms of all kinds
- Unit testing
- Building stuff
- Roller coasters

*Dislikes:*

- Python (sorry), Java (not sorry), Golang (gross)
- Data analysis (too boring)
- Peanut butter (too sticky)
